Smart Pricing Engine

The Smart Pricing Engine is a full-stack demo that shows how machine learning and optimization can be used to make data-driven pricing decisions.
It combines a FastAPI backend with an interactive web dashboard to recommend product prices that maximize profit while accounting for costs, demand elasticity, and inventory levels.

  - ML-driven forecasts: Elasticity models estimate how changes in price affect unit sales

Tech Stack

  - Backend: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Joblib

  - Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS (responsive with dark/light mode)

  - Data: CSV-based input/output for easy experimentation

  - Infra: GitHub Pages (frontend), Render/Railway (backend)

  - Extras: Slack + email alerts via webhooks/SMTP

Business Problems Solved

  - Retail / e-commerce: Prevents underpricing (lost profit) or overpricing (lost sales).

  - Inventory optimization: Flags low-stock or overstocked items with price adjustments.

  - Decision support: Provides transparent, data-driven recommendations for pricing managers.

  - Scenario planning: Profit vs. price curves let managers test “what-if” strategies.
